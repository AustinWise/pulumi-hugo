    In today's Modern Infrastructure Wednesday episode, we explore anomaly detection through Amazon GuardDuty. Code for this episode available at: https://github.com/pulumi/pulumitv/tree/master/modern-infrastructure-wednesday/2020-04-01  The examples are in TypeScript but Pulumi makes it easy to stand up infrastructure in your favorite languages including Python, JavaScript, Go, and .NET - saving time over legacy tools like CloudFormation and Terraform. https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/?utm_campaign=PulumiTV&utm_source=youtube.com&utm_medium=video  This is the first of a two part series. Next time, we'll cover anomaly detection via CloudWatch alarms.
