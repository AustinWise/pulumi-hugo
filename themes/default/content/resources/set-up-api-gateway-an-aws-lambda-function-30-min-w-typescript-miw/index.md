    For our Inaugural Episode, we’ll show you how to set up an API Gateway for an AWS Lambda function in 30 minutes using Pulumi with TypeScript. You’ll learn how to wire this up to a domain name and secure it using an API key for authorization. Finally, we’ll show you how to store the API key in a secrets manager.  Code for this episode is available at: https://github.com/pulumi/pulumitv/tree/master/modern-infrastructure-wednesday/2020-03-18/echo  The examples are in TypeScript but Pulumi makes it easy to stand up infrastructure in your favorite languages including Python, JavaScript, Go, and .NET - saving time over legacy tools like CloudFormation and Terraform.
