# Pulumi Response to HashiCorp Licensing Change

In light of HashiCorp's recent announcement regarding the Terraform transition to a Business Source License (BSL), Pulumi would like to provide clarity and reassurance to our community, partners, and customers.

### Understanding the Change

HashiCorp's decision to adopt BSL for future releases of their products has generated significant interest and raised questions within the technology community. While this change is noteworthy, it does not significantly impact Pulumi products or our commitment to open-source principles.

### Pulumi's Position

We have been closely monitoring the situation and have anticipated various scenarios related to potential licensing changes across the opensource landscape. By being prepared, we have ensured continued alignment of our values and compliance with all licensing terms.

The good news is that our current understanding of HashiCorp's announcement confirms that the affected products do not have a substantial impact on Pulumi's products or dependencies. While we do leverage some Terraform providers and SDKs, these providers will continue under the Mozilla Public License v2.0 (MPL 2.0) as confirmed in HashiCorpâ€™s announcement.

### Collaboration with Partners

We recognize the importance of collaboration and transparency. Therefore, we are actively working with our partners to verify the licensing status of these providers. It is worth noting that many of these providers are owned by our partners themselves, not HashiCorp. We are confident in our ability to navigate any potential changes and have multiple contingency plans in place, depending on the outcomes of these discussions.

### Commitment to Compliance

Our community can rest assured that we will never upgrade our dependency on any components in a way that violates the terms of the license. We remain steadfast in our commitment to ethical practices and adherence to all legal requirements.

### Looking Forward

Although HashiCorp's decisions on this matter may have surprised some, Pulumi is committed to keeping our community informed. We will continue to monitor the situation closely and update this public statement as any additional information surfaces.

Today, we want to express our gratitude to our community for their trust and support. Pulumi's mission to enable innovation and success continues to thrive, and we look forward to a bold new future as we forge ahead together.
